Instructions

1) Copy your functions.cpp file into both Graph1 and Graph2 folders and run the following commands in both folders
2) make compile (or simply "make" will do)
3) make run
4) Count the total marks printed by program in Graph1 (call it x -- these are out of 11) and Graph2 (call it y -- these are out of 11). [Note that in case of height computation, if program shows 1 mark, you add 0 to your count. You need to get 2 marks completely to get the credit for height computation.]
5) By manually looking at the code, we have given 4 marks depending on the running time of your functions. Call these marks z (these are out of 4).
6) Total marks are x  * 0.75 + y * 0.25 + z.
